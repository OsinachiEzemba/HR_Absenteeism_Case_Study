# Conclusion:
- Medical reasons emerged as the predominant cause of absenteeism, contributing significantly to the overall absences.
- Spring season consistently recorded the highest absenteeism rates across all seasons.
- Employees with fewer or no children were more prone to absenteeism compared to those with more children.
- Winter season exhibited the highest average workload per day, indicating a potential correlation with increased absenteeism.
- Individuals with fewer or no pets were found to be more likely to be absent from work.

# Recommendations:
- Implement measures to address and mitigate medical-related absenteeism, such as wellness programs or health check-ups.
- Design targeted strategies to manage and distribute workload effectively during the peak season of Spring.
- Provide additional support and resources for employees with fewer or no children to reduce absenteeism.
- Explore ways to alleviate the workload burden during the winter season, potentially through resource allocation or scheduling adjustments.
- Consider initiatives to support employees with pets, recognizing potential factors contributing to absenteeism in this demographic.
